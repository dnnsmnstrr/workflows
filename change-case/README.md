## Usage

Change the case of text on the keyboard with the keyword `case`. All six styles are previewed as Alfred results. Select one to copy it to the clipboard and paste into in the current application.

Optionally, any text typed after `case` will be changed instead of the clipboard.

Manage the keybinding (set to `Cmd+Opt+Ctrl+Shift+t` by default) to transform the currently selected text.
